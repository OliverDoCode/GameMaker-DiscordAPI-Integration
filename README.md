# 📗 Oliver's discord.gml
## a DiscordAPI library for GameMaker Studio

discord.gml is a library (in the form of a yymps file that can be imported into GameMaker Studio) that offers an easy way to program even complex Discord bots with GameMaker.

> [!NOTE]
> You can download **Oliver's GMDI .yymps file** via the **GMDI Discord:** https://discord.gg/PVV3afa3GC

## ⭐ Features
- a live connection to the Discord gateway and receive all Discord events
- an asynchronous system for HTTP requests and gateway connections with corresponding interception of HTTP errors and Discord Api errors
- easy response to interactions (buttons, text inputs, commands, select menus) thanks to GMDI's automatic response system
- almost all important http requests are available, new ones are added and updated
- simple building of objects that are sent to discord (such as a message: create_message("**Hello!**"))
- your bot can serve several Discord guilds at the same time and also process direct messages
- easy to attach files (.zip, .png and more). Compatible with GameMaker **Surfaces**, **Sprites** and **file paths** with supported formats (see [media_types](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Media_Type))
- easier and faster configuration of your Discord bot, so you can start programming immediately.
- thanks to the **house()** system, you can easily redirect interactions to a function so that you have all the code for that interaction in one script.

> [!CAUTION]
> GMDI (OliverDoCode) assumes no liability for GameMaker projects / Discord bots that regularly exceed the 
[rate limits](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/rate-limits) of the API. Every developer who creates a bot with GMDI is responsible for their own project. GMDI is **open source** and can be modified and controlled by anyone. Therefore, make sure that you **ALWAYS** download the **ORIGINAL version** of GMDI and **not a modified copy** without being 100% sure that your secret data (like the Discord bot token) will not be shared with others. 


## ⭐ How to install

[Here is a video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3g9KW8QxUM&ab_channel=OliverDoCode). 
**However, I recommend reading these instructions, as not everything is shown in the video.**

1. First check that you have the [latest version of GameMaker Studio](https://gms.yoyogames.com/ReleaseNotes.html). GMDI has only been tested with a paid version of GameMaker Studio and with the Windows operating system.

2. **Download the .yymps file.** Import the .yympd file into an empty GameMaker project (also delete the default folders and the default room in the GameMaker project)

3. Make sure that the room **DiscordBot_Interface** is set as the start room in **GMDI/System/Interface/DiscordBot_Interface** (there must be a house symbol in front of it).

4. To be able to upload/read/edit files outside of the [sanbox system](https://manual.gamemaker.io/monthly/en/Additional_Information/The_File_System.htm), make sure that the GameMaker sandbox system is deactivated in your project. 
You can do this under **Quick Access/Game Options/Windows/General/Disable file system sandbox**.


## ⭐ Configure your discord bot

1. You can create and edit your app (your Discord Bot) [here in the dev portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

2. You will find your token under the "Bot" tab in the dev portal. Reset it and copy it (treat the token like a password). Open GameMaker (with GMDI) and enter it in the **Config()** function under **GMDI/Config/Config()** in the variable **"token"** as a string.

> [!CAUTION]
> Make sure that you are using an original GMDI version that you have only downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/OliverDoCode/GameMaker-DiscordAPI-Integration) or the [GMDI Discord](https://discord.com/invite/PVV3afa3GC). Otherwise there is a risk that a modified version sends secret data to others!

3. Do the same with the **application id** and copy it. The ID can be found under the **"General Information"** tab in the dev portal.
Also add it to the variable **"application_id"** as a string in the **Config()**.

4. Your bot must be a member of at least one Guild (Discord server).
Therefore, create an installation link in the dev portal for a guild with the scopes **"bot"** and **"applications.commands"**. 
Choose which permissions you want your bot to have on your Discord server, open the link and let it join your Discord server!
[Here is a tutorial on this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3g9KW8QxUM&ab_channel=OliverDoCode)

5. Create a folder on your desktop where all bot files should be saved. Copy the path and add it to the **"path"** variable as a string in **Config()**. 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Each character **"\\"** must be double, and there must also be a double character at the **end of the path**.

6. Now you can start your bot and you should see that your bot is online on your Guild.
