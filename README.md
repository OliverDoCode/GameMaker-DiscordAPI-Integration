> [!CAUTION]
> DiscordGML/OliverDoCode assumes no liability for GameMaker projects / Discord bots/apps that regularly exceed the 
[rate limits](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/rate-limits) of the API. Every developer who creates a bot with DiscordGML is responsible for their own project. DiscordGML is **open source** and can be modified and controlled by anyone. Therefore, make sure that you **ALWAYS** download the **ORIGINAL version** of DiscordGML and **not a modified copy** without being 100% sure that your secret data (like the Discord bot token) will not be shared with others.
